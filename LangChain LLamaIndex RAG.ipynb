      " What is Pan card? The PAN card is a unique ten-digit alphanumeric identification number that is issued by the Income Tax Department of India to track the tax-related transactions of individuals and entities. The PAN card is mandatory for any financial transaction in India, including opening a bank account, buying or selling property, and filing income tax returns.\n",
      " Who needs a Pan card? All individuals/non-individuals (including foreign citizens/entities) earning taxable income in India must have a PAN card.\n",
      " Types of PAN cards In India, two types of PAN cards are available: e-PAN card and physical PAN card. 1. e-PAN card: An e-PAN card is a digitally-signed PAN card issued in electronic format. It contains the same PAN details as a physical PAN card but is available in a digital format. It can be downloaded online and used as a valid identification document for various purposes. The e-PAN card is usually issued in a PDF format. 2. Physical PAN card: A physical PAN card is a laminated card with your PAN details printed on it. It is a physical document that can be carried and used as a valid identification proof. The physical PAN card is sent to the applicant's registered address by post. Both e-PAN and physical PAN cards have the same validity and can be used for identification purposes. The choice between the two depends on the applicant's preference and requirements.\n",
      " Why do NRIs need PAN card? NRIS don’t need to have a PAN Card. However, a PAN Card is necessary for NRIs if they wish to do any of the following in India: 1. A PAN card is required to carry out financial transactions such as opening a bank account, investing in stocks, purchasing or selling property, and investing in India. 2. If an NRI earns an income in India, they must file income tax returns. A PAN card is necessary to file these returns. 3. If an NRI wants to invest in mutual funds in India, they must have a PAN card.\n",
      " Importance of PAN card for different NRI account options NRI Accounts comprise of NRE,NRO and FCNR Accounts. A basic overview to understand the importance of PAN Card with respect to these three accounts can be understood as: NRE: For funds earned outside India where both Principal and Interest earned are tax-free. Therefore, NRIs can opt for Form 60, which is a substitute for PAN for opening an NRE Account. NRO: For funds earned in India which are mostly liable to taxes. Income such as rent or pension where taxes are not deducted at source are deposited in an NRO Account. Therefore, a PAN Card is mandatory for NRO Accounts. FCNR: For foreign currency term deposits from outside India. Again, the principal and interest are tax-free, so usage of a PAN Card is not necessary and can be substituted with Form 60. \n",
      " How can NRI apply for a new PAN card Here are the steps for *PAN CARD* processing.  - Visit ABC app - Navigate to Services > NRI Pan Card > Apply New PAN - Select the required form of PAN card and proceed with the payment - Our team will get in touch with you to ask for the following documents:     - Passport(Any Country) / OCI Card     - Passport Size Photograph     - Overseas address proof with zip code (Supporting documents - Indian NRO/NRE Account statement or Overseas bank statement or Utility bill)\n",

      " Process to change the citizenship on PAN Card No direct provisions exist to change citizenship in a Pan Card as the PAN Card doesn’t display your citizenship. It is a document required to file taxes, carry out investments and do transactions in India, whether you are a citizen, NRI, or OCI. To change the citizenship in a PAN card, you must meet and notify your jurisdictional Assessing Officer. For NRIs, it is not easy to meet the assessing officer. However, ABC can meet or notify the jurisdictional assessing officer on your behalf. Contact a tax expert at ABC to change your citizenship on PAN card. Time required to update the citizenship status: Generally, it takes around a month to complete the process, but the duration can vary based on factors such as workload and the authorities' responsiveness.\n",

NRIs need a PAN card because they will be required to file income tax returns if they have rented out the property. Besides, if the property is sold later, the capital gains resulting from the sales would be subject to capital gains tax. \n",
      "What is the difference between an NRI PAN card and normal PAN card? There is no difference between an NRI PAN card and normal PAN card. An [NRI PAN card is the same as a PAN card issued to individuals living in India](https://ABC.com/blog/nri-bank-accounts/what-is-the-difference-between-an-nri-pan-card-and-a-normal-pan-card#:~:text=There%20is%20only%20one%20Pan,to%20Indian%20Residents%20and%20NRIs.).

The basic difference between a PAN Card and [Form 60](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/forms/income-tax%20rules/103120000000007944.pdf) is that you can only sign and use the Form 60 to open a bank account but in order to file taxes and carry out investments from that account, a Pan Card is mandatory.\n",
      "Can I get a new PAN card as a Canadian citizen? No, it is illegal to possess multiple PAN cards. As a Canadian citizen, you cannot obtain a new PAN card. Instead, you should update your citizenship status in the existing PAN card.\n",

However, ensuring that your PAN card reflects your updated citizenship status is crucial. You need to complete updating your citizenship in the PAN database before using it for any financial transactions or KYC requirements.\n",
      "Can the new PAN card be dispatched to my Canadian address? Yes, the PAN card can be delivered to your overseas address, including your Canadian address. While applying for a new PAN card or requesting corrections, you can provide your Canadian address as the delivery address. Make sure to provide accurate and complete address details to ensure successful delivery.\n",

      "Can NRIs make the payment for the process using an Indian bank account? Yes, NRIs can make the payment through their Indian bank accounts. However, it is worth noting that paying in Indian Rupees (INR) may be costlier due to the application of 18% GST.\n",

      "Can I apply for a PAN card if I am a non-resident Indian (NRI)? Yes, as an NRI, you can apply for a PAN card. The process for applying for a PAN card is the same for both residents and NRIs.

      "Can I take the delivery of Pan card at Indian address? Yes, you can take the delivery of your PAN card only at an Indian address mentioned in your Aadhaar card.
